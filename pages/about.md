Hello! My name is Clark Weckmann. I am an Illinois based full stack web developer. I spend most of my time dealing with git repositories, talking aloud to myself, and fixing my own mistakes. I've become a professional in the game of semicolon hide and seek as well as scrapping entire projects. Nginx is the bane of my existence but the reason for my existence.

I started dabbling in computers at the age of about 10. It all started with some batch menus and visual basic pop up messages. A youtube tutorial on "How To Make Your Own Website" taught me the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS. I quickly realized I was not meant for the front end side of development. I'm not the visual art type, this shoved me towards server-side development. I turned this into my form of art. I specialize in Node Js but also frequently use Go, Ruby, and C.
