<div class="box">Imagine a world...<br>
...where it is as simple to message or call anyone as it is to send them an email.<br>
...where you can communicate without being forced to install the same app.<br>
...where you can choose who hosts your communication.<br>
...where your conversations are secured by E2E encryption.<br>
...where thereâ€™s a simple standard HTTP API for sharing real-time data on the web.</div>

Welcome to Element

Welcome to the Matrix and Element! From here you can message anyone on any matrix server. This is possible through federation.

Federation refers to different computing entities adhering to a certain standard of operations in a collective manner to facilitate communication. It also describes operations between two distinct formally disconnected telecommunication networks with distinct internal structures. It may also describe an attempt made by groups to delegate authority of development and prevent fragmentation.
