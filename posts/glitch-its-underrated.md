__Before we dive in, I'm a firm believer in learning by doing. So if you don't want to read this post just click [here](https://glitch.com/create-project) to get started on Glitch now!__
 Glitch defines itself as 
 > Glitch: The friendly community where everyone builds the web
 
 and I couldn't agree more!
 ## For Free
Unless you plan on using Glitch for a small-scale operation that isn't just development, you can get away with the free plan! I only upgraded to give back to the developers. These people deserve it! For free you get:
* Projects and code are public by default
    * Environmental variables are always private
* Full-stack apps that sleep after 5 minutes
* Unlimited static sites that are always on
* Github import/export and Prettier support
* Custom Domains
* 512MB Memory
* 199MB Disk Space
* Terminal Access

## Starter Templates
### Glitch In Bio
Instantly create a list of your favorite links, and customize them for free.

### Website
Build a website from scratch using the basics: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It could be a splash page, VR web experiment, or personal page.

### Node.js
Do even more with JavaScript on the server! Create a full-stack Node.js project. It could be anything — an API, a web app, or a data tool.

### React
Build an interactive website with complex states using one of the web’s most widely used frameworks. Deploys as a fast, always-on static site.

### Eleventy
A simple static site generator that’s perfect for building your new blog. Eleventy removes the repetition from creating a multi-page site.

### SQLite
Use a persistent SQLite database with your Node.js app.

## Git Support
Glitch officially supports importing and exporting to Github. If Github isn't your forte, you can use the git URL to import from anywhere!

Each project is given a git URL for remote editing too. This way you aren't confined to the web IDE.
## In Conslusion
I've been using glitch since the early alpha days. Things have changed a lot over time for the better. It's the nature of development. I'm confident in what Glitch is doing and am thankful for how easy they have made my life.
