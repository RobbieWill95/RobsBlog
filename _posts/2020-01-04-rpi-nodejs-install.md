To start off we need to add the NodeJs repository to your Pi's list. Run this command:

```bash
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo bash -
```
This will enable the repository. Once it's enabled you can install NodeJs and NPM with this command.

```bash
$ sudo apt install nodejs
```
This will take awhile to install, once it's done test it with this command:

```bash
$ node -v
```

To check NPM run this:

```bash
$ npm -v
```
