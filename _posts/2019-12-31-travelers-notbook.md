The Traveler's Notebook (TN) is a brilliant design. I've been carrying notebooks for a while now and love it. My phone is good for a movie title or song I want to remember, but I just prefer pen and paper for all else.

    A Traveler's Notebook is a book-like cover that holds more than one smaller notebook or inserts with elastic bands. Each elastic band can hold up to three notebooks.

Here is an example of a TN called the Midori.

## What makes the Traveler's Notebook better?

Honestly, nothing makes a TN better. What is best for you may not be best for someone else. I love the flexibility of a TN. I can carry multiple notebooks, my notebooks stay safe in the leather cover, and I can hold extra miscellaneous things.

The biggest reason I am a TN user is flexibility. It's a leather folder with some straps. You can hold anything in this leather folder, not just your notes. I hold cash, notebooks, a pen, a photo of my wife, and any documents I'm carrying that day (sometimes even my wallet ends up in my TN).

## Set up a Traveler's Notebook.

There are hundreds of tutorials online to set up your TN so I'll skip the general setup and go to how mine is set up.

### 2 Notebooks

I carry two notebooks within my TN. One is a generalized everyday notebook the other is for transfers and loose-leaf.

My __general everyday notebook__ is set up as follows:

__CatchAll__: My CatchAll page is exactly what it sounds like. It's there for notes that are too small for an entire page but I still want to jot down.

__Quick Conversions__: I keep some handy conversions on this page. Mainly metric to imperial, a few formulas, and a map scale.

__SCRATCH__: This is just some scratch paper.

Some people refer to the scratch paper as scrap paper. There's a brilliant discussion shown on [WeAreTeachers](https://www.weareteachers.com/scratch-paper-or-scrap-paper/). I agree with [@existensil

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Scrap is scraps of paper: tear offs, leftovers from cutting, less than full size pieces, construction paper, etc.<br><br>Scratch paper is any piece of paper you use to take quick notes or work out a problem. It&#39;s your temporary workspace.</p>&mdash; Carl Zulauf ðŸŒ¹ (@existensil) <a href="https://twitter.com/existensil/status/1113568357393952769?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

My __transfer/loose-leaf__ notebook is pretty simple too. If someone asks for a piece of paper this is the notebook I tear from. This is also the notebook I will jot notes in that I want to move to a more categorized notebook.
