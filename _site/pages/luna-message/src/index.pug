    h3 A Word of Caution
    p
      | To maintain a free account I've hosted Luna Bot's code over at Glitch. This does have cons, mainly being that a third party is responsible for security and uptime. For a more secure environment, I rent out a few of my servers. If you want to be considered for this all I ask is for $2.99/mo. Luna Bot and your Quill codes will be securely hosted at https://luna.weckmann.me. For $3.99/mo, I offer custom DNS management so your API access would be via https://luna.YOURDOMAIN.com. If you want more details on this please feel free to reach out!
